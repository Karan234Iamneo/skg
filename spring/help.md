# Setting up Java 17 and Spring Boot Initializer

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up a development environment for Java 17 and create a Spring Boot application using the Spring Boot Initializer.

## Java 17

Java 17 is the latest long-term support (LTS) version of the Java programming language. It's essential for Java application development.

1. Download and install Java 17 by visiting the official website of the OpenJDK: [OpenJDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).

2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. After installation, you can verify that Java 17 is correctly installed by opening your command-line interface and running the following command:

   ```sh
   java -version

## Spring Tool Suite (STS)

Spring Tool Suite (STS) is an integrated development environment for building Spring-based enterprise applications. This guide will walk you through the steps to download and install STS on your system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A compatible operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system

### Download Instructions

1. Open your web browser and go to the official STS download page:
   [Spring Tool Suite Download](https://spring.io/tools)

2. Scroll down to find the "Download STS" section.

3. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and click on the download link. STS is available as a compressed archive file (ZIP or TAR.GZ) for your convenience.

4. Once the download is complete, navigate to your download folder.

5. Extract the downloaded archive to a location on your computer using a tool like WinZip, 7-Zip, or your operating system's built-in archive utility.

6. After extraction, you will find the STS executable file in the extracted folder. It may be named something like "SpringToolSuite4" or similar.

### Installation

1. Run the STS executable file by double-clicking it.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You may need to specify the JDK location if it's not automatically detected.

3. Once the installation is complete, you can start using Spring Tool Suite for your development projects.

### Getting Started

- When you first launch STS, you will be prompted to import or create a workspace. A workspace is where you store your projects. Choose a directory for your workspace and proceed.

- You can start creating or importing Spring projects within the workspace, and STS provides various tools and features to streamline your development process.

### Additional Resources

- For more information, tutorials, and documentation about using Spring Tool Suite, visit the official [Spring Tools](https://spring.io/tools) page.

That's it! You have successfully downloaded and installed Spring Tool Suite. Start building Spring-based applications with ease using this powerful integrated development environment.

## Spring Boot Initializer

Spring Boot Initializer is a web-based tool that makes it easy to create a Spring Boot project with custom settings.

1. Open your web browser and go to the Spring Initializer website: [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/)

## Managing Dependencies with Maven Repositories

Maven repositories are essential for managing dependencies in your Java projects. When using Spring Boot, many dependencies are automatically managed for you, but you can also add custom dependencies to your project.

1. Open your web browser and go to the Maven Repository website: [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)

Happy coding!
