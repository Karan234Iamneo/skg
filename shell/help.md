# Shell Scripting

Shell programming involves writing scripts that are executed by a Unix-like shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh, or Ksh). These scripts can automate tasks, manage files, and interact with system commands. Shell scripts are often used for system administration, software deployment, and data processing.
